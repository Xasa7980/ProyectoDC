This package includes PlayMaker Actions and event integration for DestroyIt. This makes it easy to damage, destroy, or repair destructible objects with PlayMaker, and to have Playmaker listen to those events when they occur on DestroyIt Destructible objects.

Instructions:
1) Download and import PlayMaker into your project.
2) Install Playmaker by clicking PlayMaker => Install PlayMaker from the top menu. Click the Install Playmaker button on the editor window to install it. It will import some scripts.
3) Double-click on the Unity package in this folder to unpack and install it. (Note: The PlayMaker Demo scene in this package references assets from the Demos folder. If you've already removed the Demos folder from your project, you'll need to re-import it if you want to use the scene.)
4) Launch the PlayMaker Demo scene for an interactive walk-through of the new Actions.

That's it! You're now ready to use the new Actions in your game.

NOTE: If you accidentally unpacked the PlayMakerDestroyIt package BEFORE installing PlayMaker, you will need to get your project compiling again before you can install PlayMaker. 

To do this:
1) Delete everything under the \Assets\DestroyIt\Extras (safe to delete)\PlayMaker folder except the PlayMakerDestroyIt.unitypackage and this ReadMe file. 
2) Download, import, and install PlayMaker.
3) When PlayMaker is installed, unpack the PlayMakerDestroyIt package again.
